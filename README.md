# Lab 1 - Developing a Website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

In Lab 1, you will plan and create a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code should be validated according to HTML5 standards.

By completing this lab, students will gain proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This foundational knowledge is crucial for creating web applications with modern web technologies that are responsive across various screen sizes. This lab will equip you with skills important for the remainder of the course and future practice.

## Assignment
Create a website (web application) based on one of the following options:
- A website displaying a collection of books, movies, games, or music albums
- A recipe website
- A travel destination website

The assignment must be completed individually.

### Submission Requirements
- **Wireframe:** A web prototype (wireframe) as a photo (or scanned) or from a program saved as an image or PDF.
- **Source Code:** The complete source code of the website.

#### Requirements
- **Planning:** Plan your website with a web prototype (wireframe) either on paper or using a program.
- **Website Requirements:**
  - **Homepage:** A landing page listing or displaying the content related to your chosen theme.
  - **Content Pages:** One or more pages presenting selected books, recipes, or travel destinations according to your chosen theme.
- **Technologies:** Use HTML5 and CSS for the structure and styling of the website. Apply semantic HTML and use CSS for formatting.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensure the website is functional on both desktop and mobile using CSS Grid and/or Flexbox, and possibly Media Queries if necessary.
- **Interactivity:** Implement JavaScript for user interaction features such as "rating," "wish lists," or "membership." The information should be displayed on an HTML page upon input (no need for persistent storage).
- **Validation:** Include form validation using JavaScript, in addition to HTML5 validation.
- **Data Handling:** Use JSON and Fetch API to load data on one of the pages.
- **Design:** Choose colors that complement each other and select readable fonts.
- **Code Validation:** Validate your code according to HTML5 standards.
- **Browser Testing:** Test your website in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox).
- **Advanced Responsiveness:** Adapt the website for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile views. Write custom Media Queries to adjust fonts, margins, menus, etc., for different screen sizes (can be combined with Grid and/or Flexbox).
- **Documentation:** Describe through examples how you have adapted the website for various screen sizes. Include screenshots and a brief explanation of the code. Submit this documentation in a written format (e.g., Word file) along with the source code.
- **Local Storage:** Implement functionality to save user input, such as "settings indicating what should be displayed on the homepage" or "favorite dishes" which then shows a related recipe on the homepage. Utilize Local Storage to achieve this.
